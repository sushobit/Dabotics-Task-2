# Dabotics Task-2
##  The task is to make a quiz website where students can do quizzes. Optionally you can add the ability to give a score to the user at the end of the game, if the score is above a threshold value you declare the player to be a winner, using some gifs corresponding to winning and losing the game. This can be a very interesting project to work on.
